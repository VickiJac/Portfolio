        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="bold">My name is Vicki Jacobson and I'm the employee you're looking for.
            <br>
            I'm an enthusiastic and energic individual with a "can do"-attitude. I bring a lot of creativity, new ideas and perspectives to the table. My strength lies within my passion for learning new things and develop new skills. I often find myself outside of my own area to get an understanding how everything and everyone work together to get the best end result. I'm extremely efficient and always keep a high standard with every project. I thrive in a fast moving enviroment and I'm an excellent multitasker that can quickly change focus if needed. I value a good and healthy work enviroment and balance between work and personal life above all else. I bring a lot of positive energy to the team and make sure that everyone is met with a smile and feels seen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my personal life I'm as much of a multitasker as in my work life. I have a lot of passions and I follow where my curiosity leads me. I start every morning with meditation and yoga. I love to read a good book, both fiction and non-fiction. I'm passionate about psychology and mental health. Music has always been a part of my life even though I'm not writing and playing as much anymore. At the end of the day I like to play video-games, by myself or with friends, to relax. I live with my long-term partner and our two cats, Baine and Magni.</p>
