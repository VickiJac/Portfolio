# Hello, World! :wave:

I'm a Front End Developer from Sweden. I have experience in mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have always loved tech and I even did a lot of HTML and Web Design growing up without even knowing that's what I did. I decided to give programming a proper chance and fell in love with it. Passion and learning are my two greatest motivators. I follow where my curiosity leads me and I'm a real sucker for learning new things. 

I currently working with copywriting and web publishing. In my portfolio you can find some more information about me, my career and education as well as my portfolio of projects and skills.

**Note: My portfolio is currently a work in progress. Please check back later!**
