I'm an enthusiastic and energic individual with a "can do"-attitude. I bring a lot of creativity, new ideas and perspectives to the table. My strength lies within my passion for learning new things and develop new skills. I often find myself outside of my own area to get an understanding how everything and everyone work together to get the best end result. I'm extremely efficient and always keep a high standard with every project. I thrive in a fast moving enviroment and I'm an excellent multitasker that can quickly change focus if needed. I value a good and healthy work enviroment and balance between work and personal life above all else. I bring a lot of positive energy to the team and make sure that everyone is met with a smile and feels seen.
